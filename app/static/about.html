      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="about-content">
        <div class="about-text">
          <p>I’m an IT professional with a background that ranges from service in the U.S. Air Force to supporting businesses through complex technical challenges. Over the years I’ve built a career around solving problems, improving systems, and helping teams work more securely and efficiently.</p>
          <p>Beyond work, I’m a father first. My two boys, Damien (14) and Dimitri (8), keep me motivated and grounded. When I’m not troubleshooting servers or configuring networks, you’ll find me in the gym, on a motorcycle, or in the garage working on woodworking and laser engraving projects. I’m also an avid reader of sci-fi and fantasy, always drawn to stories that spark imagination and creativity.</p>
          <p>My professional life is about technology and reliability. My personal life is about growth, creativity, and family. Together, they shape how I approach every challenge—with focus, discipline, and curiosity.</p>
